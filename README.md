# Thank you!!
Volunteers are absolutely critical to our success. We are hoping to have someone at the registration booth at all times and have one person per room on Days 1 & 2. At the registration desk you get to meet everyone as they arrive, get them checked in and be the face of FOSSETCON. Each room will need a volunteer to ensure the sound is great and to prompt the speaker on time and ensure that their talk goes well. While we ask that you sign up for a given position for either the morning or the afternoon, you are encouraged to swap individual rooms as needed with other volunteers so you get to see the talks that you want. We have a mailing list for you to facilitate this. We have a DSLR camera and need someone to pop into each of the talks, wander the halls and expo hall during breaks and take pictures.

Please sign up if you are not already on the list.
